  <div style="font-size: 28px;">Random access memory (RAM) is a 
    high-speed component in devices that temporarily stores all informationa
     device needs for the present and future. It's a type of computer memory that can be randomly accessed, 
     meaning any byte of memory can be accessed without the preceeding bytes.
     Ram is a volatile memory that is its contents are lost once there is power failure unless such contents are saved to 
     secondary storage device . It is also the basic of semiconductor memory used for temporary storage of data 
     or programs during processing. the speed and performance of a system is directly correlated with the 
     amount of RAm installed. Ram stores the information a computer is actively using, so it can be accessed quickly.
