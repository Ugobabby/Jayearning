  <div style="font-size: 28px;">
    A power supply (PS) is an hardware component  of the power supply converts a 110-115 or 220-230 volt AC (alternating current).
    The computer power supplly is the electrical source of all components
    of a computer. though it is one of the neglected one compare to the other parts, power supply is a must for a system.
    It is an internal IT hardware component. Despite the name, power supply units (PSU) Power supply units do not supply systems 
    with power - instead thay convert it. specifically, a power supply converts the alternating high voltage current (AC)
    into direct current (DC), and they also regulate the DC output voltage to the fine tolerances required for modern computing components
