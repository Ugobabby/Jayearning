  <Div style="font-size: 28px;">
    The motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer. It is the computer's central communications backbone
    connectivity point, through which all components and external peripherals connect.
    The motherboard provides the structure for all other components and connects
    them, while also providing a way to distribute power, deliver information and connect to devices. It controls how data 
    transfers and what type of monitor or screen device to use, for example. It houses the CPU, Memory and secondary storage
    devices such as hard drives. It holds the central processing unit (CPU) and other essential
    internal hardware and functions as the central hub that all other hardware components run through.
